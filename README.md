# Backpropagation neural network
**Backpropagation neural network** is classical feed-forward artificial multi-layered neural network.
Feed-forward neural networks are inspired by the information processing of one or more neural cells, called a neuron. A neuron accepts input signals via its dendrites, which pass the electrical signal down to the cell body. The axon carries the signal out to synapses, which are the connections of a cell’s axon to other cell’s dendrites.


The principle of the backpropagation approach is to model a given function by modifying internal weightings of input signals to produce an expected output signal. The system is trained using a supervised learning method, where the error between the system’s output and a known expected output is presented to the system and used to modify its internal state.

This implementation was written from scratch. After learning, it can recognize numeric characters drawn on the 7x10 canvas.
